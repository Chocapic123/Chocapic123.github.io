    <p>Ravens are really smart and beautiful animals.<br> For example they are very unforgiving and can even plan a revenge on somebody.<br>
    They have black feathers. The common raven averages 63 centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) in mass.<br>
    Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild.<br></p>
